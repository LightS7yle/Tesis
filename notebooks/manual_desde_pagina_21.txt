Lube Oil Reservoir 

Primary and Secondary AC Lube Oil Pumps 

The primary function of the lube oil system is to 
provide  an  uninterrupted  supply  of  filtered 
lubricating  oil  to  the  bearings  of  the  turbine-
generator  power  generation  train.  This  oil 
lubricates and cools the journal bearings of the 
combustion 
collector, 
starting package, and thrust bearing. This oil is 
supplied  at  a  regulated 
temperature  and 
pressure  to  allow  safe,  dependable  operation 
during  power  generation  train  rotation.  This 
includes start-up, power generation, shutdown, 
coast-down, and turning gear operation. 

turbine,  generator, 

The  secondary  function  of  the  lube  oil  system 
is to provide working oil to the torque converter 
(hydraulic coupling), to cool combustion turbine 
supports,  and  to  initially  fill  or  supply  the  seal 
oil system.  The SGT6-6000G uses a separate 
system  for  providing  working  oil  to  the  torque 
converter. 

The  scope of  design  for  the  lube  oil  system  is 
shared  between  several  engineering  groups. 
Collectively,  they  form  a  complete  lubrication 
oil system  meeting all functions and functional 
requirements.  

The  Mechanical  Auxiliaries  Design  Group’s 
scope  consists  primarily  of  all  ancillary 
equipment  required  to  deliver  the  oil,  at  the 
required  conditions,  to  the  duty  components 
(e.g.,  bearings,  torque  converter,  and  turbine 
support). The components related to this scope 
are discussed in detail later in this description.  

Other  Siemens  Power  Generation,  Inc.  design 
sections  are  responsible  for  interconnecting 
piping,  foundation  details,  electric,  and  duty

LUBRICATION SYSTEM

The  lube  oil  system  has  from  one  to  four 
customer connections consisting of:

and control purposes. The oil system also uses 
several  local  connections  to  perform  system 
service.  These  connections  are  discussed  in 
further detail in the following sections. 

The  overall  design  of  the  lube  oil  system  is 
dictated  by  the  bearing  characteristics.  The 
delivery  pressure,  total  flow  and  heat  duty  of 
the  bearings,  ultimately  determine  the  size,

For 
the  SGT6-3000E  and  SGT6-5000F 
ECONOPACS™,  the  reservoir  is  integrally 
fabricated  into  the  structure  of  the  mechanical 
package.  The  SGT6-6000G  frame  uses  a 
stand-alone, 
foundation-mounted  cylindrical 
tank.  The  reservoir  provides  sufficient  volume 
to maintain retention capacity sufficient enough 
to  support  turbine  shutdown  in  the  event  of 
major  oil  system  leakage.  It  also  provides 
sufficient residence time for oil de-aeration and 
tramp particulate settling, and contains system 
runback  volume  for  the  oil  system  when  it  is 
taken off line. The reservoir is internally baffled 
to maximize residence time. It is also internally 
coated with an oil resistant paint to protect the 
parent  metal  in  times  of  extended  shutdown. 
Reservoir heaters are provided to heat the oil, 
bringing  it  to  proper  viscosity  prior  to  system 
start.  The  reservoir  is  also  equipped  with  a

The  water-cooled  heat  exchanger  assembly  is 
a  skid-mounted  arrangement  of  one  or  two 
plate  and 
frame-type  coolers.  This  cooler 
consists  of  a  series  of  thin  plates  mounted  in 
close  proximity  to  each  other.  Hot  oil  and 
cooling  water  flow  on  alternate  sides  of  these 
gasketed  plates  and  in  opposite  directions. 
This allows efficient heat transfer from the oil to 
the  cooling  water  system.  All  turbine  frames 
offer  simplex  and  duplex  cooler  options.  Each 
cooler is sized for 100 % of the expected duty 
plus  a  margin  for  system  fouling.  The  duplex 
arranged  coolers  are  placed  in  and  out  of 
service  by  the  operation  of  a  six-way  transfer 
valve.  This  valve  helps  provide  sufficient  oil 
system  isolation  to  perform  maintenance  on 
the standby cooler. Each cooler has individual 
vent,  drain,  and  pressure  equalization 
provisions for operation and maintenance. The 
cooler(s)  and  associated  oil  piping,  transfer 
valve,  temperature  control  valve,  and  water 
piping  are  skid-mounted  on  the  roof  of  the 
mechanical  package  for  the  SGT6-3000E  and 
SGT6-5000F ECONOPACS™.  

The SGT6-6000G also uses a similarly skidded 
assembly but is mounted on a structure above 
the  lube  oil  reservoir.  For  all  turbine  frames, 
the  cooling  water  connections  are  customer 
connections.  Plate  and  frame  (water-cooled) 
lube  oil  coolers  are 
the  ECONOPAC™ 
standard for combined-cycle operation.  

Alternatively,  horizontal  shell  and  tube  heat 
exchangers  can  be  used  in  a  similar  manner 
as  described  above  for  the  plate  and  frame 
heat  exchanger.  Cold  water 
is  circulated 
through  the  tubes  in  a  two-pass  arrangement. 
Hot  oil  is  circulated  through  the  shell.  Finned

Each 
element(s)  capable  of  accommodating  100  % 
maximum  system  flow  and  can  filter  the  oil  to 
the required bearing cleanliness (typically 25 µ 
absolute)  in  a  single  pass.  Like  the  duplex 
cooler  arrangement, 
filters  are 
placed  in  and  out  of  service  by  operation  of  a 
six-way transfer valve. This valve helps provide 
sufficient  isolation  to  perform  maintenance  on 
the  standby  filter.  Each  filter  has  individual 
vent,  drain,  and  pressure  equalization 
provisions for operation and maintenance. The 
filter assembly is located on top of the reservoir 
for 
the  SGT6-3000E  and  SGT6-5000F 
ECONOPACS™; drainage is accomplished by 
opening  vessel  drain  valves.  The  assembly  is 
located  on  the  pump  supply  skid,  which  is 
grade mounted for the SGT6-6000G. Drainage 
for the SGT6-6000G filter vessels is facilitated 
with  a  permanently  installed  inline  manual 
pump.  

This  valve  maintains  the  bearing  header  at  a 
constant  pressure  during  system  operation. 
This  valve  is  typically  a  globe  valve  that  is 
directly  actuated  by  downstream  oil  pressure. 
Regulation 
is  accomplished  by  balancing 
forces on each side of the actuator diaphragm. 
Valve  downstream  pressure  is  opposed  by 
forces  from  the  valve  and  spring  adjustment. 
This  arrangement  will  cause  the  valve  to  fail 
open upon loss of sensing line pressure. Once 
the  regulating  valve  is  set,  no  other  valve 
adjustment 
is 
neither controlled nor monitored by the control 
system.  It  is  located  in  piping  as  part  of  the

LUBRICATION SYSTEM

the  rotating  shaft  of 

100% centrifugal blowers. Each blower is rated 
to  provide  a  predetermined  vacuum  in  the 
ullage  space  of  the  lube  oil  reservoir.  The 
ullage space is piped to the bearing pedestals 
and  drain  system  in  order  to  maintain  a  slight 
vacuum  in  these  portions  of  the  system.  This 
causes  small  amounts  of  air  to  be  drawn 
between 
the  power 
generation  train  and  associated  shaft  seals, 
preventing  oil  from  leaking  out  of  the  system 
through  its  capillary  action  along  the  shaft. 
Each  blower  takes  individual  suction  from  the 
oil  mist  eliminator  which,  in  turn,  takes  its 
suction  from  the  reservoir  ullage  space.  Each 
blower  also  incorporates  a  check  valve  in  its 
suction  line  to  prevent  exhaust  airflow  from 
short  circuiting  back  into  the  OME.  The  vapor 
extractor  blowers  connect 
in  a  common 
discharge  line  that  incorporates  a  common 
throttling or damper valve. This valve is used to 
control the vacuum in the oil system. The flow 
from  the  blower(s)  is  silenced  and  discharged 
to  atmosphere.  This  discharge  is  a  customer 
connection  for  ECONOPACS™  located  inside 
a building.  

The  oil  mist  eliminator 
is  a  coalescing 
assembly  that  collects  entrained,  atomized  oil 
from  air  extracted  from  the  oil  system.  The 
suction  (inlet)  of  the  vessel  is  taken  from  the 
reservoir  ullage  space.  Oil  mist  then  passes 
through  one  of  several  elements  which 
coalesces  the  oil  into  droplets.  These  droplets 
collect in the bottom of the vessel and return to 
the  reservoir  through  a  pipe  connected  to  the 
lowest  practical  point  in  the  reservoir.  This 
creates  a  loop  seal  which  ensures  that  the 
vacuum  differential  between  reservoir  and 
vessel  cannot  draw  oil  into  the  OME  through 
the  drain  line.  The  loop  seal  also  serves  to 
ensure that the vacuum cannot empty the drain 
line  creating  a  bypass  around  the  OME.  The 
entire OME assembly is mounted on or above 
the reservoir to allow proper drainage.

One  of  the  AC-powered  lube  oil  pumps  is 
selected  by  the  operator  as  the  primary  pump 
using the pump selector switch in the AC motor 
control  center.  Operator  selection  of 
the 
primary  pump  is  usually  predicated  on  pump 
total  run  time.  This  is  logged  on  the  elapsed 
time meters in the AC MCC. Once a pump has 
been  selected  as  primary,  it  is  placed  in 
service  by  positioning  its  HAND-OFF-AUTO 
switch in AUTO. Once satisfactory operation of 
the primary pump is verified by actuation of its 
discharge  pressure  switch  (PS34101  or  02), 
the standby pump HAND-OFF-AUTO switch is 
also  placed  in  the  AUTO  position.  These 
switches are also located in the AC MCC. The

speed.  The  oil  mist  eliminator/vapor  extractor 
can  now  be  placed  in  service  much  the  same 
way  as 
the  main  oil  pumps.  The  vapor 
extractor start permissive has been satisfied by 
the  presence  of  bearing  supply  pressure.  One 
of  the  vapor  extractor  blowers  is  selected  as 
primary  by  positioning  the  selector  switch 
inside  of  the  AC  MCC.  The  primary  blower  is 
then  energized  by  placing  its  related  switch  in 
AUTO.  The  other  vapor  extractor  blower  is 
placed  in  idle  standby  by  also  positioning  its 
switch in AUTO. 

With  the  system  in  operation,  initial  valve 
adjustments and flows may be verified. Trickle 
flow  should  be  evidenced  in  the  sight  flow 
indicator  from  the  cooler  assembly  (FG34121) 
and  the  in-service  filter  vessel  (FG34122  or 
23). This trickle vent prevents the collection of 
air inside vessels or headers. This ensures use 
of  all  available  filter  or  heat  transfer  surface 
area. Failure to accomplish this could result in 
unnecessary alarms or  trips. For operations in 
extreme  cold,  the  high-pressure  header  drain 
line should provide a trickle flow to allow fin-fan 
cooler drainage in times of system shut down. 
The  damper  in  the  vapor  extractor  discharge 
may  be  adjusted  to  obtain  proper  reservoir 
vacuum  level.  All  of  these  valves  may  require 
readjustment  after  the  system  has  reached 
steady-state 
temperatures  and  pressures; 
however, further adjustment of these valves is 
infrequent.  

The  lube  oil  system  is  a  complete  closed-loop 
controlled  system.  Once  placed  in  operation, 
no  direct  monitoring  of  the  system  is  required 
by the operator.  

For  SGT6-6000G  applications,  a  branch 
connection  is  provided  upstream  of  the  heat 
exchanger  for  oil  supply  from  the  seal  oil 
system.  This  is  accomplished  by  bypassing 
regulated amounts of hot oil around the cooler 
where  it  is  then  mixed  with  the  cooled  oil. 
Temperature  is  closed  loop  controlled  by  the 
control  system  using  the  signal  output  from  a 
downstream  thermocouple  to  pneumatically 

control  the  cooler  bypass/temperature  control 
valve.  To  ensure  the  coolers  are  not  partially 
air  bound,  vessels  or  headers  will  have  their 
associated  vent  valves  cracked.  Flow 
is 
verified  in  the  cooler  vent  sight  flow  indicator 
(FG34121).  This  trickle  vent  keeps  the  cooler 
full,  allowing  use  of  all  available  heat  transfer 
area.  Temperature  indicators  (TI34114  and15) 
provide  local  indication  of  oil  temperature  in 
and out of the cooler.  

Cooled  oil  is  then  piped  to  the  duplex  filter 
assembly.  A  branch  connection  prior  to  the 
filters  connects  the  accumulator(s)  to  the  oil 
system.  The  accumulator(s)  provide  make-up 
flow  in  the  event  of  a  pump  transfer,  dampen 
oil pressure pulsation from the main oil pumps, 
and  suppress  initial  pressure  surge  during 
pump  start-up.  Oil  passes  through  the  first 
ports  of  the  six-way  transfer  valve  to  the  in-
service filter.  

Filter  element  cleanliness 
is  monitored 
indirectly by the pressure differential indicating 
switch  (PDIS34105),  locally  mounted  on  the 
filter  assembly.  The  vessel  containing  dirty 
elements is taken out of service by positioning 
the 
this, 
transfer  valve.  To  accomplish 
pressure  in  the  vessels  must  be  equalized  to 
allow  the  transfer  valve  to  be  unseated  and 
rotated.  This  is  the  normal  operating  condition 
as the equalization line between the vessels is 
normally  open.  Dirty  elements  may  now  be 
serviced  once  the  pressure  in  the  standby 
vessel is isolated and vented to ambient. All of 
this  is  accomplished  with  no  interruption  in 
service.

Alarm conditions also exist relating to reservoir 
oil level. For water-cooled heat exchangers, an 
alarm  activates  on  high  level  (LSH34149)  as 
possible  indication  of  gross  water  leakage 
across the heat exchanger into the oil system. 
A  low  oil  level  alarm  (LSL34119)  is  also 
initiated  at  a  measured  height  above  the  level 
of pump suction loss. 

Other  alarm  conditions  may  exist  relating  to 
bearing  metal  temperature  (part  of  turbine 
supervisory 
instrumentation)  or  bearing  oil 
supply  temperature  (TE34116).  Like  all  alarm

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 

CAUTION 

I.L. 1800-4324
0803

The  starting  system  provides  a  capability  for 
remote  automatic,  unattended  start-up  of  the 
turbine. 

also 

incorporates 

Primary motive power for starting the turbine is 
provided  by  a  1640.5  kW  (2,200  HP)  squirrel 
cage electric motor.  Since the electric starting 
motor  does  not  have  the  low-end  torque 
characteristics  needed  to  drive  the  turbine  at 
starting  load,  a  hydraulic  torque  converter  is 
used  to  achieve  required  torque.    The  torque 
high-speed 
converter 
characteristics  required  for  turbine  start-up.  
The  turning  gear  (located  between  torque 
converter  and  clutch)  provides  breakaway 
torque  when  starting  from  a  standstill.    It  will 
also  maintain  turbine  and  exciter  generator 
shaft rotation at 2.5 rpm for a cooldown period 
after  shutdown.    The  clutch  engages  and 
disengages the starting motor and turning gear 
with  the  turbine-generator  unit  shaft  during 
turbine  start-up  and  shutdown.    Cooling  oil  for 
the torque converter, clutch and starting motor 
is supplied by the turbine lube oil reservoir. 

OPERATION DESCRIPTION 

Turbine Acceleration 

the 

torque 

Following  a  start  signal,  the  motor  quickly 
accelerates  to  3,600  rpm;  energy  converted 
through 
converter  gradually 
accelerates the turbine.  At ignition, the turbine 
begins to help itself accelerate.  The turbine is 
motor-assisted,  through  the  torque  converter, 
to  2,304  rpm  where  the  start  is  deenergized 
and  declutched.    The  turbine  will  continue 
acceleration  to  synchronous  speed  of  3,600 
rpm. 

After  two  successive  aborted  start 
cycle  attempts  have  been  made,  do 
not  attempt  another  start  until  the 
cause  of  the  malfunction  has  been 
determined

and 
corrective  action  taken.    Multiple

Normal Start Cycle 

A normal start cycle, as defined for the starting 
package, 
consists  of  approximately  90 
seconds  of  unit  acceleration  to  ignition  speed.  
This  will  vary  based  on  ambient  temperature 
and  conditions.    From  the  time  a  start  is 
initiated,  the  turbine  must  reach a minimum of 
225 rpm within 60 seconds or a trip occurs.  A 
maximum  of  120  seconds  is  allowed  from  the 
time  the  machine  reaches  225  rpm  until  the 
ignition speed is achieved, or a trip ensues. 

For  dry  low  NOx  applications,  the  ignition 
speed is 600 rpm for gas fuel. 

Flame Sensing and Turbine Speed 

In  the  case  of  gas  firing  after  fuel  valves  are 
opened, igniters will fire for 7 sec. If flame has 
not  been  sensed  by  either  of 
flame 
scanners  in  this  time  frame,  the  machine  is 
tripped. 

the 

A time of no more than 120 seconds is allowed 
from  flame  being  sensed  to  1,400  rpm.    Upon 
reading  2304  rpm,  the  starting  package  is 
disengaged.    The  turbine  then  becomes  self- 
sustaining to idle speed. 

Turbine  speed  is  sensed  by  two  magnetic 
pickups  located  at  the  starting  package.    The 
median  value  of  these  pickups  is  used  to 
determine speed.

Prior  to  starting  the  instrument  air  system, 
valve,  electrical,  instrumentation,  and  controls 
line-up of the system should be accomplished. 
The Instrument Air compressor is energized by 
closing  the  breaker  on  the  AC  MCC  in  the 
electrical  package,  and  placing  the  Hand-Off-
Auto  switch  to  Auto.  Once  accomplished,  the 
system will run in automatic mode with little or 
no operator assistance. 

After  system  pressure  increases  above  655 
kPa  (95 lbf/in2), 
the  plant  Control  System

Trip or Normal Shutdown 

If  the  engine  trips  or  a  normal  shutdown 
occurs, the instrument air system will continue 
to  all  users.  The  only 
to  distribute  air 
interruption in  service  would  be  due  to  a  plant

Alarms/Trips 

If  system  pressure  drops  to  827  kPa  (120

The  Control  System  alarm  will  clear  once 
system  pressure  has  increased  to  1034  kPa 
(150 lbf/in2). An electrical interlock level switch 
(LS43321)  located  on  the  compressor  will 
prevent  it  from  operation  of  the  compressor  if 
the oil level within the crankcase is too low.

INLET AIR SYSTEM 

INLET AIR SYSTEM 

The  inlet  air  system  of  the  combustion  turbine 
cleans  incoming  air  and  channels  it  to  the 
compressor inlet with minimal turbulence.  It is 
comprised of two major sections: the inlet filter 
house, and the inlet duct and silencer system. 

Rows  and  columns  of  modular  filter  elements 
are  stacked  up  inside  the  inlet  filter  house.  
Weatherhoods  and  other  optional  equipment 
such  as  inlet  air  heaters/chillers,  evaporative 
coolers  (with  mist  eliminators),  bird  screens, 
trash  screens,  etc.  that  help  to  clean  the  air 
and/or  protect  the  filter  elements  are  also 
completely  contained  within  the  inlet  filter 
house  structure.    Please  refer  to  the  specific 
section(s) that follow for descriptions of each of 
the respective options that applies to your unit. 

The  inlet  duct  and  silencer  system  consists  of 
an  extension  duct,  silencing  section(s),  an 
optional  turning  section,  and  a  transition  duct.

STANDARD TWO-STAGE STATIC SYSTEM 
DESCRIPTION  

For this application, a two-stage static inlet air 
filtration  system  is  used.    In  this  system, 
incoming  air  simply  flows  through  two  sets  of 
filters passing clean air on into the turbine inlet.  
While  specific  designs  vary  somewhat,  the 
filters in the first set of the system are generally 
referred  to  as  pre-filters,  and  those  in  the 
second 
filters.  
Replacement  of  the  filters  is  necessary  and 
the  accumulated  buildup  of 
required  as 
particulates  eventually  has  an  adverse  effect 
on  the  performance  of  the  unit.    An  indication 
that it’s time to replace the filters is provided by 
a pressure differential signal measured across 
the  filter  elements.    Weatherhoods  are  also 
provided  at  the  inlet  of  the  filter  house  to

distribution header.  As the air passes through 
the  cooler  media,  the  moisture  on  the  wetted 
media  evaporates  into  the  air  stream.  This 
cools  the  air  flow,  which  then  travels  into  the 
mist  eliminators.    The  mist  eliminators  are 
made  of  either  of  an  aluminum  vane  or 
chevron-type design.  In this section, the larger 
water particles are removed from the air.  This 
in turn allows the now cooled, moist air to pass 
on  through  the  duct  and  silencer  section  and 
on to the compressor bell-mouth.

Exhaust Stack (Simple Cycle Only) 

The  exhaust  system  of  a  simple  cycle 
application  includes  the  expansion  joint  and 
exhaust  transition  and  terminates  through  an 
exhaust stack. 

Sound attenuation is performed in the stack by 
a  set  of  silencing  baffles.    Once  the  gas  has 
passed  through  the  silencer  section  of  the 
stack, the gas is discharged into atmosphere. 

Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  ports

The  exhaust 
is  equipped  with 
additional  instrumentation  when  a  combined 
cycle application is used.  The instrumentation 
is  provided  remotely  on  an  exhaust  pressure 
panel  (EPP).    The  standard  EPP  is  equipped 
with  two  (2)  pressure  switches.    An  optional 
pressure transmitter can be provided.   

Exhaust  Stack  with  Diverter  Options 
(Simple Cycle/Combined Cycle) 

This  exhaust  system  includes  the  expansion 
joint,  exhaust 
transition  with  additional 
instrumentation  and  an  exhaust  stack  with 
options  to  convert  from  simple  to  combined 
cycle application. 

To  accomplish  this  conversion,  the  exhaust 
stack  is  provided  with  all the components of a 
simple  cycle  stack  but  also 
includes  an 
additional automatic diverter damper or manual 
blank-off plate. 

The manual blank-off plate option is for a “one-

FUEL GAS SYSTEM 

GENERAL DESCRIPTION 

Overspeed Trip Valve 

I.L. SGT6-5000F-IL105_1006

The fuel gas system controls the flow of gas into the 
combustion  system  for  all  operating  modes  of  the 
is 
turbine.  Over-fuel  and  over-speed  protection 
designed  into  the  system.  A  functional  double-block-
and-bleed valve arrangement isolates the gas turbine 
from  the  fuel  gas  supply  when  the  unit  is  not 
operating. 

The  fuel  gas  system  is  designed  to  operate  with 
natural  gas.  Fuel  quality  must  be  in  accordance  with 
Siemens PG fuel specifications. Fuel gas is supplied 
from  the  purchaser’s  pressure  regulating  station  to 
the  boundary  of  the  fuel  gas  system  located  just 
outside of the turbine enclosure. 

The  fuel  gas  system  provides  a  precisely  controlled 
flow of clean and dry gaseous fuel to the gas turbine. 
The  system  begins  with  a  filter/separator.  The  gas 
supply feeds four “stages” (Pilot, Stage A, B, and C), 
which  supply  gas  to  different  nozzle  sections  of  the 
combustor.  Piping  for  each  stage  contains  a  flow 
meter with transmitter and a throttle valve. All stages 
feed  individual  ring  manifolds,  which  then  distribute 
the gas to all 16 combustors. 

SYSTEM COMPONENTS 

The fuel gas filter separator is located outside of the 
turbine enclosure. The remaining system components 
are  located  in  the  fuel  gas  piping  assembly  between 
the  fuel  gas  filter  separator  and  the  gas  turbine 
mounted fuel gas manifolds. 

Fuel Gas Filter Separator 

The  separator  consists  of  a  pressure  vessel  with  a 
drain  section  and  a  filter  section.  A  differential 
local 
pressure-indicating  switch 
indication  and  remote  monitoring  by  the  control 
system  of  the  filter  pressure  drop.  Level  switches 
monitor  fluid  levels  and  provide  alarm  signal  to  the 
control room. 

is  provided 

for 

This  pneumatically  operated,  diaphragm/spring 
balanced high speed butterfly valve is used to isolate 
the  plant  fuel  gas  supply  whenever  the  GT  is 
shutdown.  The  valve  is  fail-safe,  i.e.,  it  will  close  at 
loss  of  pneumatic  air.  The  valve  is  ANSI  leakage 
Class V category. 

Vent Valve 

This  valve  is  a  pneumatically  actuated  ball  valve,  air 
to close/fail open.  

This  valve  functions  in  a  double-block-and-bleed 
arrangement with the overspeed trip valve and throttle 
valves. Collectively, these valves isolate fuel gas from 
the  turbine  when  the  unit  is  not  operating.  Any 
trapped  fuel  gas  from  the  gas  piping  assemblies 
downstream  of  the  overspeed  trip  valve  is  vented  to 
the atmosphere. 

Throttle Valves (Pilot Stage, Stage A, Stage B and 
Stage C) 

These  hydraulically  actuated  valves  control  the  fuel 
gas flow through the Pilot, A, B, and C stages of the 
combustion  system  in  response  to  signals  from  the 
control system. The valve actuators are double-acting 
hydraulic  pistons  with  integral  servo-valve  controllers 
and position feed-back sensors. A filter is provided in 
the hydraulic fluid supply line on each actuator. 

Fuel Gas Manifolds 

fuel  gas  manifolds  are  ring-shaped  piping 
The 
assemblies  which  surround  the  compressor  casing 
adjacent to the combustor section. Four manifolds are 
provided,  one  for  each  stage  of  the  combustion 
system.  Each  manifold  distributes  fuel  gas  to  the 
piping  connections  on  the  16  fuel  nozzles.  The 
manifolds  are  connected  to  the  fuel  nozzles  with 
flexible hoses to allow for thermal expansion.

energized  and  air  pressure  must  be  available.    Loss 
of electrical power to the solenoid valve will close the 
overspeed trip valve. 

CAUTION 

The  overspeed  trip  valve  should  not  be 
manually  opened  unless  the  fuel  gas 
supply  has  been  isolated  and  tagged  out 
upstream of the valve. Failure to do so will 
result in fuel gas discharge to atmosphere 
through the vent valve.

INDICATIONS 

Fuel Gas Filter Separator Level Switches 

These instruments monitor the fluid levels in the fuel 
gas  filter  separator.  An  open  contact  indicates  the 
condition  of  high  liquid  level  requiring  the  fuel  gas 
separator tank to be drained. 

Gas  Filter  Separator  Filter  Cartridges  Differential 
Pressure Switches 

These instruments monitor the cleanliness of the gas 
filter  separator  filter  cartridges.  An  open  contact 
indicates  that  it  is  time  to  change  or  clean  the 
cartridges. 

These  instruments  provide  a  signal  to  the  control 
system for the fuel gas pressure upstream of the OST 
valve. 

Individual Stage Branch Orifice DP Flow 
Transmitters (Pilot, A, B, and C Stages) 

These  instruments  monitor  the  pressure  drop  across 
flow orifices located in the Pilot stage, Stage A, Stage 
B, and Stage C fuel gas piping. The signals are input 
to the turbine control system for calculation of fuel gas 
flows. 

Throttle Valve Differential Pressure Transmitters 

These  instruments  monitor  the  pressure  drop  across 
the  Pilot  stage,  Stage  A,  Stage  B,  and  Stage  C 
throttle  valves.  The  signals  are  input  to  the  control 
system to determine the required valve stroke. 

Over-fuel  Protection  Panel  Differential  Pressure 
Transmitters 

These  devices  are  located  in  the  turbine  pipe  rack, 
and sense the differential pressure between each fuel 
gas  manifold  and 
the  combustor  shell.  The 
transmitters detect an over-fuel condition at ignition. If 
a  high  differential  pressure  is  indicated,  the  start-up 
sequence  will  be  aborted  and  an  alarm  will  occur. 
This  action  only  operates  during

OPERATION 

Pre-operation 

The major valves of the system are aligned to provide 
double  block  and  bleed  isolation  from  the  fuel  gas 
(FG) header. The FG overspeed trip valve is shut, the 
individual  stage  throttle  valves  are  shut  and  the  vent 
to atmosphere is open. 

Start-up 

During  turbine  run  up  the  speed  ramp  is  paused  at 
purge  speed  for  a  predefined  time  to  purge  any 
remaining  flammable  gases  from  the  heat  recovery 
steam  generator.  The  turbine  is  then  ramped  to 
ignition  speed.  On  completion  of  the  purge,  the 
starting  motor  reduces  the  speed  to  the  ignition  set 
point,  igniters  are  energized  and  fuel  is  admitted  to 
the combustor as follows. The vent valve closes, the 
overspeed trip valve opens and the fuel is supplied to 
the throttle valves. The Pilot and the Stage A throttle 
valves  are  opened  to  their  ignition  set  points.  On 
verification  of  “flame  ON”  the  fuel  is  ramped  to  the 
post-ignition set point. The fuel is then increased by a 
ramp generator in the control system and at the same 
time  the  gas  turbine  is  accelerated  again  by  the 
starting  device.  At  approximately  1500 
rpm 
determination  of  the  fuel  gas  mass  flow  demand  is 
switched  from  the  ramp  generator  to  closed  loop 
speed control. 

The  control  system  controls  the  valve  positioning  to 
and  through  synchronization,  when  the  generator 
breaker  closes  and  the  control  system  switches  to 
load  control.  The  load  setting  and  ramp  rate  is 
controlled  by  the  operator.  When  the  load  reaches 
approximately 30 % the B stage valve opens and the 
A stage throttles until they both provide the same fuel 
flow.  They  continue  opening  and  at  approximately 
50 %  load  the  C  stage  throttles  open  until  a  power 
limit  is  reached  or  the  exhaust  temperature  limit  is 
reached  (base  load).  The  Pilot  is  always  open  some 
percent. 

Shutdown 

During  Shutdown  the  fuel  gas  throttle  valves  reduce 
flow at an operator determined ramp rate until power 
reaches  minimum  load  (approximately  4  MW).  The 
generator  breaker  opens  and  the  shut  down  is 
completed by tripping the turbine. 

Turbine Trip 

A  turbine  trip  is  provided  to  protect  the  turbine  from 
unsafe  operating  conditions  and  is  used  as  the  final 
step  of  the  shutdown.  When  a  trip  signal  is  received 
the following sequence occurs in the fuel gas system. 
The  over  speed  trip  valve  shuts.  All  fuel  gas  throttle 
valves shut and the vent valve opens. The block-and-
bleed  valve  arrangement  isolates  all  fuel  flow  to  the 
combustion turbine.

COMPRESSOR WATER WASH SYSTEM 

SYSTEM OVERVIEW 

During  normal  operation  of  the  combustion 
turbine,  a  build-up  of  foreign  material  on  the 
axial  compressor  blading  can  be  expected.  
Substances  such  as  dust,  salt,  grease,  and 
hydrocarbon  vapors  become  entrained  in  the 
inlet air and are deposited on both the rotating 
and  stationary  compressor  blading.    Such  a 
build-up is found predominantly on the first few 
rows.  This build-up decreases compressor air 
flow  and  discharge  pressure,  turbine  inlet  and 
the 
exhaust 
turbine load capacity. 

temperatures,  and  ultimately 

Capacity fouling can be detected by observing 
a  decrease  in  compressor  discharge  pressure 
at  constant  speed  and  load.    It  can  also  be 
detected  by  observing  a  reduction  of  load 
capacity  with  a  corresponding  lowering  of

SPPA-T3000™ CONTROL SYSTEM 

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 

INTEGRATED SUBSYSTEMS 

The  Siemens  Power  Generation,  Inc.  SPPA-
T3000™ Control System performs sequencing, 
monitoring, controlling, and protective functions 
for  the  gas  turbine  portion  of  the  plant.    The 
principal operator interface for the plant is also 
contained in this system. 

Major  features  associated  with  the  control 
system include: 

Automatic  speed/load  and  temperature  control 
for  the  gas  turbine  generator  at  all  stages  of 
operation  (from  turning  gear  to  maximum  load 
capability). 

Gas  turbine  protection  when  safe  operating 
limits are exceeded or when any serious plant 
disturbance occurs. 

Visual  display  of  plant  instrumentation  for 
control  and  maintenance.    Operator  interface 
to  allow  selection  of  operating  modes.  
Optional fuel selection capabilities may also be 
included. 

Speed,  combustor  shell  pressure,  megawatt 
output, and exhaust temperature are measured 
by  the  control  system  and  used  to  meter  fuel 
flow  to  the  gas  turbine.    The  control  system 
automatically  sequences  various  pumps  and 
valves  during  operation  to  coincide  with  start-
up and loading of the gas turbine. 

The  control  system  is  implemented  by  an 
SPPA-T3000™  Process  Control  System  and 
several integrated subsystems. 

SPPA-T3000™ PROCESS CONTROL 
SYSTEM 

The  SPPA-T3000™  Automation  Control 
System provides integrated modulating control, 
sequential  control,  and  data  acquisition 
capabilities  for  the  gas  turbine.    This  system 
incorporates  a  terminal  bus  link  connecting 
several  types  of  major  components.    Some 
components are capable of driving peripherals, 
such as printers and storage devices. 

The  Digital  Control  System  includes  several 
subsystems, which are hardwired to the SPPA-
T3000™. 

Local Panel 

The local panel is located in the electrical skid 
and  contains  components  which  are  best 
located  closer  to  the  gas  turbine  than  the 
central  control 
room,  such  as  vibration 
monitoring subsystem. 

Vibration Subsystem 

The vibration subsystem is located in the local 
panel  on  the  electrical  skid  and  consists  of  a 
monitor  for  each  channel  of  vibration.    It  also 
contains  the  power  supply.    Each  monitor 
receives 
transducers.  
These  monitors  provide  a  DAS-compatible 
signal output.  They also provide two levels of 
vibration out-of-limits conditions alarm and trip.

input 

Dynamics Monitoring Subsystem 

The dynamics monitoring subsystem is located 
in  a  cabinet  in  the  electrical  skid  and  consists 
of  a  monitor  for  each  combustion  basket.    It 
also contains the power supply.  Each monitor 
transducers.  
receives 
These  monitors  provide  seven  dynamics 
frequency  bands  per  combustion  basket  that 
are monitored by the local dynamics system for 
various alarm levels.

Motor Control Center 

The  Motor  Control  Center  located  on  the 
electrical  skid  is  a  primary  interface  for  output 
and  input  signals  to  and  from  the  SPPA-
T3000™. 

Field Instrumentation 

See  other  sections  of  this  publication  for 
information on field devices wired to the SPPA-
T3000™  I/O  such  as  valves,  transducers, 
switches, 
transmitters,

TURBINE OPERATOR’S PRIMARY 
CONTROL EQUIPMENT 

This  leaflet  describes  operation  of  the  turbine 
operator's  primary  control  equipment  for  the 
TXP™ Control System. 

Plant  status  and  alarm  displays  are  dedicated 
to  informing  the  operator  of  new  alarm,  trips 
conditions and ready to start messages, etc. 

BASIC OPERATING TERMINAL MONITOR 
OPERATION 

General  operating  instructions  for  the  TXP™ 
operator stations are detailed in the Operating 
Manual, Document OM-650. 

A  variety  of  information  is  depicted  on  the 
graphic screen diagrams.  The main part of the 
graphic  uses  different  methods  intended  to 
best  display  the  type  of  data  available:    tile 
mimics  for  alarms,  control  station  templates 
similar to analog instrument faces, bar graphs, 
trend  charts,  and  other  representations  of 
process information. 

CAUTION 

Do  no  operate  the  TXP™  while 
connected  to  an  operating  plant 
unless  you  have  received  thorough 
training  on  TXP™  System  and 
combustion turbine processes. 

MAIN SCREEN DIAGRAMS 

Main  Screen  Diagrams  primarily  consist  of 
Process  Diagrams,  Control  Panel  Diagrams, 
and Plant Status and Alarm Display.

Control  Panel  Diagrams  are  special  diagrams 
used to monitor and control combustion turbine 
equipment.    These  diagrams  may  contain 
process point information, operator messages, 
valve control pushbuttons, etc.  Most control on 
these  diagrams  will  also  involve  a  two-step 
process. 

Analog  Faceplate  Diagrams  are  used 
to 
monitor/control  analog  devices,  of  which  the 
combustion turbine has very few.  Control of an 
analog  device  involves  a  two-step  process.  
First  the  operator  pokes  the  title  block  of  the 
M/A, which activates control.  Then the control 
keys  (on 
the  membrane 
keyboard) can be used to control the device.

MAIN SCREEN DIAGRAMS - 
CONSTRUCTION 

Main  diagram  screen  is  constructed  in  this 
way. 

All  main  diagrams  are  built  using  the  Main 
Screen  Template  Diagram,  which  includes  a 
title  and  8  analog  process  point  blocks  along 
the  bottom.    The  remaining  space  is  used  for 
the  process  diagram  or  analog  faceplates.  
Note  that  date  and  time  are  always  displayed 
in the upper left Operator’s Console. 

Process  diagrams  consist  mainly  of  process 
lines, devices (pumps, fans, etc.), and process 
points. 

Control  panel  diagrams  consist  of  individual 
functions, plant status and protective functions 
for plant operation. 

Plant  Status  and  Alarm  displays  consist  of 
tabular  blocks  that  provide  the  operator  with 
plant  state  conditions:    Not  ready  to  start, 
Ready to start, trip, and alarm status. 

MAIN SCREEN DIAGRAMS - DISPLAY 

Main  screen  diagrams  are  displayed  by 
selecting  a  pull  down  menu  at  the  top  of  the

TURBINE OPERATOR'S PRIMARY
CONTROL EQUIPMENT

Main Screen Diagrams 

On  process  diagrams,  poke  fields  are  drawn 
near  each  controllable  device.    The  poke  field 
for  a  digital  device  will  display  the  appropriate 
the  control 
pop-up  window,  and  activate 
algorithms  for  the  device.    A  poke  field  for  an 
analog device displays the appropriate Analog 
Faceplate Diagram. 

POP-UP WINDOW DIAGRAMS 

Pop-Up  window  diagrams  are  used  for  the 
display of Control faceplates. 

Control  of  digital  devices  requires  a  two-step 
process.    First,  when  the  operator  "pokes"  the 
device  (pump,  valve,  etc.)  on  a  process 
diagram  or  control  panel  diagram,  the  pop-up 
diagram  for  that  device  will  be  displayed.  
Second,  the  control  of  the  device  will  be 
activated by selecting the window.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 

The  combustion  turbine  temperature  control 
system  consists  of  32  thermocouples.  Sixteen 
thermocouples  sense  temperature  conditions 
at  the  exit  of  the  turbine  blade  path  directly 
downstream  of  the  last  row  of  turbine  blades.  
Sixteen  thermocouples  sense  the  temperature 
further  downstream  in  the  turbine  exhaust 
system.

while  on  temperature  control.  During  starting 
and at low load, these thermocouples have no 
control  function.  They will, however, generate 
an  alarm  if  average  temperature  exceeds  the 
established set point. 

When it is desired to fully load the turbine or to 
maximize  the  exhaust  gas  temperature  for 
boiler  operation,  the  exhaust  temperature  is 
used as the control function.  Because of their 
position  farther  downstream  in  the  hot  gas 
path,  exhaust  gas  thermocouples  get  a  better 
mixing  and  closely  represent 
turbine

OTC Operation 

The  OTC  (Outlet  Temperature  Correction) 
methodology  controls  the  engine  at  Part  and 
Full  Load  conditions  with  the  exhaust  gas 
temperature.  This  control  will  constantly 
maintain  a  temperature  value  between  engine 
exhaust  and  actual  exhaust  temperature  limit. 
The OTC process is a function of Compressor 
Inlet 
Exhaust 
Temperature,  and  Engine  Speed.  The 
relationship is formulated to control the engine 
to  a  corrected  exhaust  temperature  based  on 
variations  in  ambient  temperature  and  engine 
speed.

(UV) radiation at wavelengths within the range

flames  but  not  in  significant  amounts  by  other 
activity  within

EMERGENCY TRIP SYSTEM – SGT6-5000F

I.L. SGT6-5000F-IL250_0606

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 

The  SGT6-5000F  gas  turbine  trip  system  will 
trip  the  unit  automatically  based  on  a  number 
from 
of  conditions,  as  well  as  manually 
emergency  trip  pushbuttons  located  at  the 
Pressure  Switch  and  Gauge  Panel,  the  local 
panel  in  the  electrical  package,  and  in  the 
central control room. 

the  overspeed 

All  trips  are  designed  to  operate  both  of  two 
separate paths for fuel shutoff.  The main path 
(OST) 
is 
solenoid/fuel valve driven by a trip relay, which 
is activated redundantly by a hard-wired string 
or  via  an  output  from  the  Siemens  Digital 
Control System (DCS). 

system 

trip 

Each  path  operates  by  removing  air  from  its 
pneumatically actuated fuel valve and shutting 
off  fuel  to  the  turbine.    For  failsafe  operation, 
the mode of all spring return solenoid and fuel 
valves  in  the  trip  system  is  to  de-energize  to 
shut off fuel. 

The SGT6-5000F gas turbine has several sets 
of  conditions  that  will  initiate  an  automatic 
turbine trip such as high vibration, fire, etc., but 
special  attention 
to  overspeed 
conditions. 

is  paid 

The  SGT6-5000F  overspeed  trip  system  is  a 
dual  electronic  one-out-of-two  with 
fault 
tolerance. 

The  primary  portion  of  the  system  consists  of 
two  speed  sensors  located  in  the  starting 
package  area  which  operate  in  conjunction 
with the Siemens Control System logic to shut 
off fuel through the main and backup paths as 
described above. 

The  secondary  portion  of  the  overspeed  trip 
system  has  two  speed  sensors  monitoring  the 
turbine shaft at the coupling cover area.  Each 
of  these  sensors  is  connected  to  a  dedicated, 
diverse tachometer, either of which will operate 
the  trip  relay,  and  therefore  the  main  path  to 
shut off fuel. 

Fault-tolerant  design  allows  under  certain 
conditions  the  failure  of  a  single  primary  or 
secondary speed sensor, Siemens DCS circuit 
tachometer  while  still  avoiding 
card,  or 
nuisance 
to  provide 
trips  and  continuing 
adequate overspeed protection. 

Also,  various  diagnostic  health  checks  are 
conducted  to  the  overspeed  trip  system  each 
time the unit is accelerated.

PANEL SELECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS 

In  the  following  table,  local  operator  actions 
and  observations  are  described  sequentially.  
The  options  at  each  step  of  the  sequence  are 
explained  in  the  text.    Some  modes  may  be 
changed after starting, if desired. 

The Digital Control System (DCS) provides the 
operator  with  a  fully  Automatic Start and Load 
(to  maximum)  when  selected  on  the  Operator 
Panel.  The system also allows for holding the 
unit  at  key  events  in  the  sequence  and  for 
operating at partial loads as desired. 

This  procedure  describes  the  activity  of  the 
operator and observations that are available to 
bring  the  turbine  from  Ready-to-Start  State  to 
Initial Loading output operation. 

Both  Automatic  and  Manual  Synchronization 
are described in this leaflet. 

PRECAUTIONS 

A  Start  Cycle,  as  defined  for  the  Starting 
Package,  consists  of  a  90  second  unit 
acceleration  (approximately)  to  ignition  speed 
by the Starting Motor, followed by a 12 second 
(45  seconds  for  fuel  oil)  ignition  attempt.    If 
ignition  has  been  successful,  acceleration  of 
the turbine and generator unit, with the help of 
the  starting  motor,  is  continued  up  to  2,304 
rpm1.    At  this  speed,  the  starting  motor  is  de-
energized and disengaged.

STARTING SEQUENCE

Package  will  either  accelerate  the  turbine  to 
ignition  speed  or  allow  the  turbine  to  coast 
down  to  just  below  ignition  speed  before 
resuming acceleration to ignition speed. 

Gas Ignition Flow 

Gas ignition flow goes to all 16 nozzles through 
the  OST  Valve,  Pilot  and  Stage  A  Throttle 
Valves.    The  igniters  are fired for 12 seconds.  
Oil  ignition  is  only  through  the  pilot;  and,  the 
igniters fire for 45 seconds. 

Flame Monitoring Combustors 

Flame on control logic indicates that flame has 
propagated  through  the  cross-flame  tubes  to 
each combustor.  A trip will occur if the control 
logic  does  not  sense  flame  during  the  Ignition 
Sequence. 

Fuel Ramp 

As  soon  as  flame  is  established,  the  Fuel 
Ramp begins.  The flame detection logic must 
sense  flame  consistently  throughout  the  ramp 
for  9  seconds  to  continue  the  sequence.  Fuel 
is  scheduled  at  a  programmed  rate.    The  unit 
acceleration is monitored.  If at a specific point 
in  the  Starting  Cycle  the  acceleration  is  not 
above  minimum  allowable  specifications,  an 
alarm is set.  If it is lower still by a preset rate, 
a shutdown occurs.  This check begins at 1400 
rpm1. 

At 2304 rpm1, the starting device is cut 
off.    The  turbine  is  then  self-sustaining 
to synchronous speed. 
Upon reaching 1500 rpm1 speed control 
takes over in the Start Sequence. 

IGVs  are  scheduled  as  a  function  of 
speed throughout Start-Up. 

Bleed  valves  are  closed  as 
the  unit 
accelerates.  HP bleed valve is closed at 3200 
± 20 rpm1 and the LP bleed valve is closed at 
3325 ± 20 rpm1.  Failure of bleed valves to be 
in proper position will result in a GT trip. 

The speed control will take the turbine to 98 % 
speedi.    At  this  point,  the  unit  is  ready  to  be 
synchronized. 

Automatic Synchronizer 

The Automatic Synchronizer raises and lowers 
generator  speed  and  voltage  to  match  the 
system speed (frequency) and voltage.  When 
the match is within the setting of the Automatic 
Synchronizer,  the  selected  system  breaker  is 
closed  and  an  increment  of  load  (minimum 
load) is picked up.  The system breaker closing 
command passes through a Synchro Acceptor 
mounted  in  the  protective  relay  cabinet.    The 
device  prevents  breaker 
closure  when 
conditions are unacceptable. 

System Breaker 

When  the  System  Breaker  is  closed  and 
minimum load is picked up, the unit will hold at 
this load unless a megawatt demand has been 
set  previously.    This  megawatt  demand  is  set 
via  the  Operator  Console  Graphic  and  can  be 
changed  at  any  time.    The  controls  will  raise 
the 
the 
demand  or  until  the  exhaust  temperature  limit 
of  the  unit  is  reached  (whichever  is  lower).  
The  temperature  limit  varies  with  ambient 
temperature  and  is  a  function  of  combustor 
shell  pressure.    IGV  will now be positioned as 
a function of load.

PARTIAL LOAD OPERATION 

OVERVIEW 

Unit  output  can  be  set  at  any  point  between 
minimum  load  (approximately  4.5  MW)  and 
maximum  load  (temperature  limit  of  the  unit). 
This control system includes a load control for 
use when the unit is to remain in a fixed partial-
load operation.  

DESCRIPTION 

Load Control (Droop-Type) 

Load control is a droop-type control used when 
multiple  generating  units  are  connected  to  the 
same  grid.  The  load  control  regulation  is 
factory-set  at  4 %.    In  other  words,  with  the 
speed  reference  unchanged,  a  4  %  change  in 
speed  or  frequency  will  result  in  a  100  % 
change  in  rated  load.    (Rated  load  is  defined 
as  base  load  at  ISO  conditions.)  If  the  unit  is 
generating base load at 100 % speed, the load 
is  suddenly  lost,  and  the  system  breaker(s) 
sensed by the control system do not open, the 
control  would  cause  the  turbine  to  increase 
speed  to  104  %  (assuming  that  the  speed 
reference  is  not  changed).  For  the  other  case 

I.L. 1800-4788
0803

where  the  speed  (frequency)  is  decreased  by 
one  percent,  the  control  will  cause  load  to 
increase  by  an  increment  of  25  %  of  rated 
load.  

Load Rate Limiter 

A  load  rate  limiter  is  contained  within  the 
control  system  to  limit  load  pickup  to  10  %  of 
rated  load  (base  ISO)  during  instantaneous 
frequency decay. There is no restriction to load 
shedding. 

Output Load and Load Set Point 

When  the  unit  is  operating  in  Load  Control, 
increasing  or  decreasing  the  Load  Set  Point 
can change the Output Load. This change can 
be made either manually or automatically. The 
Load  Set  Point  can  be  either  increased  or 
decreased manually by selecting Load Control 
Select  and  entering a Load Target Value. The 
speed  reference  cannot  be  manually  lowered 
below minimum load. 

The  load  reference  is  automatically  lowered 
when  the  normal  stop  switch  is  selected,  or 
during an auto unload.

NORMAL SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES 

By depressing the “for normal stop” key on the 
operator’s  console,  the  operator  initiates  an 
automatic  shutdown  sequence.    This  is  the 
preferred method of unit shutdown.  Depending 
on  the  operating  point,  the  control  sequence 
will be as follows: 

When  the  unit  is  at  load  and  normal  stop  is 
selected,  the  control  will  reduce  load  at  a 
predetermined 
rate  dependent  on  boiler 
constraints not to exceed 18.6 MW per minute. 

IGV  and  combustor  bypass  valves  will 
automatically  reposition  themselves  as  the 
load

schedules. 

is  decreased 

When a minimum load of 4.5 MW is reached, 
the  system  breakers  will  open  and  a  300 
second  cooldown  timer  is  started.    Upon 
expiration  of  the  timer,  the  control  shuts  off 
fuel,  opens  the  bleed  valves,  and  opens  the 
field  breaker.    The  turbine  will  then  coast 
down  from  3600  rpm  to  0  rpm,  at  which  time 
turning gear operation will commence.  As the 
speed  decreases  below  225  rpm,  the  turning 
gear motor will energize.  If the motor has not 
started within 10 seconds after the speed has 
decayed  below  this  setpoint,  an  alarm  will  be 
initiated.    Prior  to  fuel  shutoff,  selecting  GO 
cancels the normal stop.

EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN PROCEDURE 

By depressing the trip pushbutton, the operator 
initiates  an  emergency  shutdown.    The  trip 
should only be used in an emergency condition 
because  of  the  severe  temperature  transient 
induced  in  the  unit.    When  the  trip  pushbutton 
is depressed, the control reacts as follows: 

1.  Fuel is immediately shut off. 

2.  Generator breaker is opened (if closed). 

3.  Bleed valves are opened (if closed). 

4.  Field breaker is opened (if closed). 

5.  Inlet guide vanes are closed. 

6.  Steam injection isolation valve is closed (if 

used). 

7.  Start device is shut off (if on). 

8.  During turbine coast down, the turning gear 
motor  is  energized,  just  as  in  a  normal 
shutdown.  Upon reaching zero speed, the 
unit initiates turning gear operation. 

9.  The  same  sequence  of  events  occurs  on 
an  automatic  control  system-initiated  trip.  
The cause of the trip is frozen on the CRT 
trip  trap  to  assist  in  troubleshooting  the 
problem.    An  emergency  trip  pushbutton 
also  exists  on  the  pressure  switch  and 
gauge  cabinet  and  will  bring  about  the 
same shutdown.

of time.  In this way, whatever work is required 
with  the  shaft  at  rest  can  be  accomplished.  
The amount of time the shaft is not rolling is a 
function of temperature, but should not exceed 
one minute before it is repositioned. 

If  the  turbine  has  been  out  of  service  for  an 
extended period and off turning gear, 24 hours 
of  operation  is  recommended  before  starting.  
It  is  understood  that  this  may  not  be  practical 
for some users. 

If  it  is  necessary  to  energize  the  turning  gear 
and  start  immediately,  the  turbine  may  exhibit 
vibration  levels  higher  than  normal.    This 
vibration, however, should subside shortly after 
starting. 

Should  loss  of  AC  power  to  the  unit  occur 
during  a  shutdown,  it  is  imperative  to  provide 
DC  power  for  a  minimum  three  hours  to

Index  and  tag  the  location  of  all  parts  to  be 
disconnected  or  removed  in  order  to  facilitate 
reinstallation.  This 
important 
is  especially 
where rotating parts are concerned. 

When conducting repairs, it is considered good 
practice to provide pans for holding bolts, nuts, 
and  small  parts  as  they  are  removed.  These 
containers  should  be  labeled  to  show  the 
location  of  parts.  They  should  also  be  kept 
covered until time for reassembly. 

Markings  on  Materials  Subject  to  High 
Temperatures 

Only  approved  markers  or  their  equivalents 
may  be  used  on  engine  materials  exposed  to 
high  temperatures.  No  other  markers  may  be 
used  on 
turbine  blades,  vanes,  nozzle 
assemblies, discs, or any other part subject to 
high temperatures. 

CAUTION 

The  use  of  nonapproved  marking 
material,  such  as  common  pencil 
lead,  on  materials  subject  to  high 
temperatures  may  cause 
turbine 
contamination  or  cracking  of  detail 
parts. 

Anti-Seize Compound Usage 

Bolt  threads  and  nut  bearing  surfaces  should 
be  well  lubricated  with  acceptable  non-seizing 
compounds  to  avoid  thread  seizure  and  to 
reduce  friction,  especially  in  high  temperature 
turbine areas. 

The  use  of  anti-seize  compounds  in  any  area 
requires  that  cleanliness  be  maintained.  Dirt, 
oil, grease, or other foreign matter can reduce 
the effectiveness of the compound.

Laboratory  examination  of  certain  gas  turbine 
components,  such  as  turbine  diaphragms  and 
vane  segments,  has  shown  evidence  of 
corrosion  in  the  area  of  the  shroud  rails.  The 
cause  of  this  corrosion  has  been  traced  to 
excessive  use  of  anti-seize  compound  on  the 
mating  surfaces  of 
turbine 
components  and  permitting 
the  excess

BOLT/NUT TIGHTENING 

Alloy  steel  bolts  and  studs  used  in  high 
pressure  and  high  temperature  flanges  should 
be  torqued  to  produce  a  stretch  of  0.0381 

mm/mm  (0.0015  in/in)  of  free  length.    This 
generates  a  required  stress  of  310  MPa 
(45,000 psi). 

Tighten  all  nuts  of  1.9  cm  (0.75  in)  diameter 
and  up  with  a  91  kg  (200  lb)  steady  pull  on  a 
wrench  handle  length  of  305  mm  for  each  25

Lockwire  should  always  be 
installed  and 
twisted  to  prevent  the  loop  from  slipping  over 
the  fastener  and  to  avoid  any  rotation  that 
would allow the fastener to loosen. See Figure 
1. 

Fasteners or fittings that are spaced more than 
152 mm (6 in) apart should not be lockwired to 
each other. Use tie points that are provided on 
adjacent parts. See Figure 2. 

Closely  spaced 
fittings  are 
considered  to  be  spaced  with  a  maximum  of 
102 mm (4 in) between centers. 

fasteners  or 

A  607  mm  (24  in)  length  of  wire  is  the 
maximum length of wire to be used in a series 
of fasteners. 

Widely spaced fasteners or fittings spaced 102 
mm  (4  in)  to  152  mm  (6  in)  apart  should  not 
have  more  than  three  units  in  a  series.  See 
Figure 3. 

Twisted lockwire between fasteners should be 
tightened  to  prevent  side  motion.  Do  not  over 
stress wire. 

A pigtail of 6 mm to 13 mm (0.250 in to 0.500 
in) length (3 to 6 twists) should be made at the 
end of the wiring pattern. See Figure 4. 

When  castellated  nuts  are  to  be  secured  with 
lockwire,  tighten the nut to the low side of the 
selected torque range (i.e., last nut slot to align 
with  bolt  hole  before  application  of  torque). 
See Figure 5. 

For plain nut application, drill hole through nut 
in accordance with Table 1. Do not attempt to 
retain  the  nut  by  drilling  only  the  bolt.    See 
Figure 6. 

Hollow-head  bolts  are  lockwired  in  the  same 
manner as regular bolts.

REASSEMBLY OF COMPONENTS 

Before  and  during 
reassembly,  perform 
thorough  checks  for  any  loose  parts,  tools, 
rags, or other items that might inadvertently be 
left  inside  the  equipment.    Check  all  pipe 
connections and other openings to ensure that 
all temporary closures have been removed. 

Wipe  all  joints  and  parts  clean.    Bearing 
surfaces  should  be  lubricated  prior  to  final 
positioning of rotating components. 

OIL CIRCULATION 

After assembly or following a major inspection, 
circulate oil through the system to flush out any 
foreign matter that might cause a failure during 
operation.    Check  the  oil  circulation  diagram 
and  instructions  for  detailed  description  and 
procedures to be followed.  After oil circulation 
is  completed,  clean  and  install  all  removed 
parts before the turbine is placed in operation.

of 

In  order  to  check  parallel  alignment  of  mating 
components,  it  is  necessary  for  the  coupling 
spigot to permit feeler gauge measurement all 
around.    Take  gauge  readings  of  the coupling 
gap 180º apart and mark with crayon or chalk.  
If  the  readings  are  not  alike,  subtract  the 
smaller from the larger and note on which side 
of the shaft the difference lies.  Turn the shaft 
through  180º  and  measure  the  gap,  again 
taking the difference and noting on which side 
the difference lies.  If the difference remains on 
the  same  side,  add  the  amounts  of  the  net 
opening  (if  they  are  not  equal)  and  divide  by 
two.  If however, the net opening has changed 
from  one  side  to  the  other,  then  subtract  the 
smaller from the larger and divide the result by 
two.  The result in each case will give the true 
opening  between  coupling  faces.    Align  the 
shafts  to  give  a  residual  reading  of  zero.  
Check again for correct alignment. 

Comparative  coupling  gap  measurements  are 
made  with  the  coupling  bolts  removed;  feeler 
gauge  measurements  are  taken  while  still 
spigotted together. 

Coupling  offset  is  measured  from  the  outside 
diameter of the mating couplings with the shaft 
centerlines  in  parallel.    Any  difference  in  the 
outside  diameter  of  the  couplings  must  be 
compensated for when taking measurements. 

ACCESS TO MAJOR ASSEMBLIES 

Complete  inspection  or  major  repair  of  the 
combustion  turbine  requires  removal  of  major 
assembly  covers.    It  is  recommended  that  a

V-BELT INSPECTION, TENSIONING, AND 
MAINTENANCE 

I.L. 1800-4355
0403

OVERVIEW 

V-Belts  and  their  associated  sheave  grooves 
should be inspected semi-annually. Belts must 
be taut with a 0.39687 mm  deflection per mm 
(1/64 in per in) of span length. Sheave grooves 
must  be  clean,  geometrically  sound,  and  free 
of rust and burrs.  

V-BELT INSPECTION PROCEDURE 

To properly inspect V-Belts: 

1.  De-energize the fan motor. Open the circuit 

breaker and tag in the open position. 

2.  Remove fan motor fuses. 

WARNING

inspection  or 
Before  performing 
maintenance  procedures  on  electrical 
equipment,  open  the  circuit  breaker 
and  tag  open.  Remove  all  associated 
fuses.  Improper  isolation  of  electrical

4.  Inspect  all  sheave  grooves.    Remove  any 
oil or grease deposits and eliminate rust of 
burrs.    If  grooves  show  signs  of  wear, 
replace sheaves to ensure proper V-Belt fit.  
Use  groove  gauges  to  validate  proper 
geometry of sheave grooves. 

5.  Verify  proper  line  up  of  motor  and  fan 
shafts.    These  shafts  must  be  parallel  to 
each  other  in  order  to  avoid  improper  belt 
line up. 

6.  Check V-Belt tension. 

V-BELT TENSIONING PROCEDURE 

When  V-Belt  tensioning  is  required,  be  sure 
that the slack in each belt is on the same side 
of  the  drive.    Loosen  all  motor  mount  hold-

down bolts and adjust V-Belt tension using the 
full-threaded  adjusting  bolts.    These  adjusting 
bolts  are  located  on  both  sides  of  the  motor 
mount.    Always  use  the  same  amount  of  take 
up  on  each  tensioning  bolt  until  the  belts  are 
reasonably  taut.  The  drive  can  be  energized 
temporarily 
to  help  seat  each  belt  in  its 
respective groove.

OVERVIEW 

assist  maintenance 

To 
in 
determining  when  maintenance  is  required, 
initial pressure settings of all equipment should 
be  noted.    This  should  give  pressure  drops 
across  all  equipment  in  the  clean  condition.  A 

personnel 

large  change  in  pressure  drop  should  be  an 
indication of problems, either increased airflow 
or  dirty  equipment.    See  Table  1,  Auxiliary 
Compressed Air Systems Troubleshooting. 

Table 1.  Auxiliary Compressed Air System Troubleshooting 

CONDITION 

CAUSE 

CORRECTIVE ACTION 

Compressor 
runs 
continuously 

Compressor 
malfunction  

Refer to Compressor Maintenance Leaflet. 

Leak in 
tubing/instruments 

Listen for leaks with the unit at standstill and compressor 
not running.  Soap-bubble check all joints.  Tighten all 
leaking joints.  Replace faulty instrumentation. 

Receiver Tank Dump 
Valve stuck open 

Instrument Air 
Regulator diaphragm 
ruptured 

Remove valve and clean. 

Refer to Maintenance Instructions for Instrument Air 
Supply Regulator. 

Low Instrument 
Air pressure 

Incorrect settings of 
instruments 

Set all controls per Control Settings drawings 

Air Receiver Tank not 
charged 

Determine if Compressor is operating.  Refer to 
Compressor Maintenance Leaflet. 

Excessive pressure 
drop across filters or 
dryer 

Listen for leaks with the unit at standstill and compressor 
not running.  Soap-bubble check all joints.  Tighten all 
leaking joints.  Replace faulty instrumentation 

Frozen 
Instrument Air 
Lines 

Water in Instrument Air 
Lines 

Check for clogged traps or drains causing water to 
accumulate in filters and dryer.  Refer to Maintenance 
Instructions for instrument air filters, instrument air float 
trap, instrument air dryer, and automatic drain valve. 

Check dryer for proper operation. 

Check all filters and traps for proper operation.  Correct 
all air leaks.  Excessive airflow through the air system 
could overtax equipment and prevent efficient operation.  
This may result in moisture-saturated air.
