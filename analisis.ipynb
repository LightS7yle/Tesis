       " 'an eiatia232 to eiatia485 converter in chapter 2. the eiatia 485 option directly supports communication with up to 32 devices on a network or up to 247 devices using a 485 repeater . basic communications settings must first be config ured on the controller on the setup page . match the baud rate baud to that of the computer and select a unique address addr for each series sd31 . to view or change controller settings with a personal computer , you need to run software that uses the mod bus rtu protocol to read or write to registers in the controller . see the parameter tables for information about the modbus registers . these registers contain the parameter values that determine how the controller will function and current input and output values of the sys tem . the address in the tables have been offset by sub tracting 40,001 from each one . two consecutive registers are addressed for 32bit data types . the first word , or lower register number , contains the two higher bytes . the second word , or high er register number , contains the two lower bytes of the four byte integer value',\n",
       " '. setting up a modbus network 1. wire the controllers . the series sd31 uses an eiatia485 serial port , which is not typically found in a pc , but can be found on many plcs . the type of port found in a typical pc is an eia232 port . internal eiatia485 pc ports are available , but the most common way for a pc to commu nicate using a eia485 port is with an eiatia232 to eiatia485 converter . see selecting an eiatia232 to eiatia485 converter in chapter 2. the advantages of eiatia485 are that it is less susceptible to noise and it allows a pc or plc to com municate with multiple controllers on the same port to form a network . it is important when using eiatia 485 , to install the termination resistors along with pull up and pulldown resistors to ensure reliable communi cations . some newer pcs may only have a usb port . usbto serial adapters usually eiatia 232 are available from a variety of different pc vendors . some companies offer adapters to convert from usb to eiatia485 directly . 2. configure each controllers communications pa rameters on the setup menu',\n",
