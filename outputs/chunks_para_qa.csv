sd31_manual.pdf,"once communications is configured , test the link to the controller for verification that everything is wired and configured properly . check the wiring and configu rations if things arent working . one misplaced wire or one incorrect setting will keep communications from working . when using an eia232 to eia485 converter , be sure to follow the configuration instructions provided with the converter , as some may require special jumperswitch settings , external power supply require ments or special signals from the software . some soft ware packages have builtin routines for testing the communications or use comm6 to help diagnose prob lems . 7. start communications with the controller . with the communications successfully verified , the software is now ready for use with the controller . the above guidelines are the general steps to establishing communications with controllers using modbus . some applications may require other steps not mentioned , but would follow the same general process . 8. programming and configuring the controllers . when programming and configuring the controllers with a software program , a couple of things must be kept in mind . if the software allows changing setup pa rameters such as input"
